# Legendre's Approximation Theorem

## Theorem

> [!theorem] Legendre's Approximation Theorem
> Among two consecutive [[continued-fraction-convergents|convergents]] $p_n/q_n$ and $p_{n+1}/q_{n+1}$, at least one of them satisfies
>
> $$
> \left|\xi - \frac{p}{q}\right| < \frac{1}{2q^2}. \qquad (\ast)
> $$

> [!theorem] Converse: Characterization of Convergents
> Additionally, if $p/q$ satisfies $(\ast)$, then $p/q$ is a convergent of the continued fraction expansion of $\xi$.

This gives a ==sharp criterion== for identifying convergents: a rational $p/q$ is a convergent of $\xi$ if and only if it satisfies the $1/(2q^2)$ bound.
