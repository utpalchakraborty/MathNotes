# Smart Alec Quotes

> Cauchy, Weierstrass, and Riemann basically spent their careers writing the fine print on Euler's checks.

> Functions *are* their coefficients, period - Riesz Fischer!

> The Riemann world gets you 90% of the way there with Parseval, but it's like building on sand — your space has holes. Lebesgue fills the holes, L² becomes complete, and suddenly the isometry becomes an isomorphism. The same pattern as ℚ → ℝ, really.
