In other words, $\mu(n) = 0$ whenever $n$ is divisible by $p^2$ for some prime $p$, and $\mu(n) = (-1)^k$ when $n$ is a product of $k$ distinct primes.

## Connection to the Zeta Function

The Möbius function appears as the coefficients in the [[dirichlet-series|Dirichlet series]] for the reciprocal of the [[riemann-zeta-function|Riemann zeta function]]:

$$
\frac{1}{\zeta(s)} = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^s}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}.
$$

This identity follows from expanding the Euler product: each factor $(1 - 1/p^s)$ contributes either $+1$ or $-1/p^s$, and multiplying over all primes selects exactly the squarefree integers, with sign $(-1)^k$ determined by the number of prime factors.
